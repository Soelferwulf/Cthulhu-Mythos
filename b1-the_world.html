                                    One of the true treats in literature is when an author is capable of creating a
                                    literary world. Not just a good book but a complete universe that encapsulates the
                                    story being told. J K Rowling's Harry Potter books are a perfect example of this. In
                                    her books we not only read about Harry Potter and his adventures at Hogwart's School
                                    of Witchcraft and Wizardry but we explore a magical world that exists side by side
                                    with us, in the shadows of our own very world. It's rare but for those authors who
                                    can create and flesh out these fictional universes it's a fantastic treat for their
                                    readers. <img class="card-image rpg-image text-wrap"

                                    you this ability isn't limited to just writers of the traditional
                                    fictional novel. George Lucas did it with his Star Wars Universe. Gene Roddenberry
                                    with Star Trek, Stan Lee with the Marvel Super Hero Universe and L. Frank Baum with
                                    his Land of Oz. It is this creation of a complete world in which their stories take
                                    place that raises their work and helps the story being told reach a new level of
                                    depth for it's audience.</p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">H P Lovecraft is one such writer. His creation is
                                    called
                                    the Cthulhu Mythos and it is a world of cosmic monsters, horror and
                                    madness.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">The term "Cthulhu Mythos" is generally attributed to
                                    August Derleth, a writer and early fan of Lovecraft, who later founded Arkham House
                                    publishers, dedicated to keeping in print the collected works of Lovecraft. Today,
                                    the term embodies a fictional cosmology of alien gods and monsters, arcane lore, and
                                    themes that represent “Cosmic Horror,” where humanity’s existence is unimportant in
                                    the grand scale of the universe.</p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">While humanity might crave both comfort and the truth,
                                    only one or the other is possible on the cosmic scale of the Cthulhu Mythos. Faced
                                    with alien god-like beings, the human mind is an inflexible container and cannot
                                    fully contain the cosmic truth. <sup>[2]</sup></p>

                                    with humanity. Some may personify cosmic principles like time and matter. Only a few
                                    of these deities seem to take an interest in human affairs or even acknowledge the
                                    existence of the human race. When they do, they often are shown trying to break
                                    through cosmic walls or dimensions in order to wreak destruction. The Outer Gods are
                                    represented, to some extent by their messenger and soul, Nyarlathotep. When the
                                    Outer Gods are discomforted, Nyarlathotep investigates. Azathoth, a mindless
                                    abomination at the center of the universe, sleeps to the piping of a demon flute
                                    players. Yog-Sothoth is coterminous with all time and space, but locked somehow
                                    outside the mundane universe. Such beings are very powerful and, should they be

                                    Gods, but are nonetheless god-like and terrible to human senses. Humans are much
                                    more likely to worship Great Old Ones, who are comparatively near at hand and who
                                    occasionally participate in human affairs or contact individual humans. Human cults
                                    usually secretly worship a particular Great Old One. Such beings are immensely
                                    powerful entities with supernatural-seeming abilities, but many appear to be
                                    temporarily imprisoned in some way. It is said that “when the stars are right” the
                                    Great Old Ones will plunge from world to world, bringing madness and death in their
                                    wake. When the stars are not right, they cannot “live”- meaning that they are dead
                                    but sleeping, but will one day reawake.</p>

                                    for the unwary to explore and uncover the horrors within. Others, like the Mi-Go,
                                    come from outer space to Earth to conduct cruel and bizarre experiments, and also to

                                <p class="card-text text-justify">When a human allows and welcomes the “voices” of
                                    Mythos entities into their mind, the channel is open to receive an ongoing stream of
                                    cosmic thought, twisting perceptions while empowering them through knowledge that
                                    they can bring to bear upon their fellows and the world around them. Ultimately, for
                                    most, this can be described as power—power over others, power over life, and power
                                    over death. Mythos knowledge burns brightly and is a fire of desire, something to be
                                    lit and nurtured. Yet, it is a fire of contagion also, spreading and infecting, and
                                    ultimately burning out the human center till nothing human remains. This is the
                                    terrible path of cultists who worship these alien beings.</p>

                                <p class="card-text text-justify">Setting plays a major role in Lovecraft's fiction. A
                                    fictionalized version of New England serves as the central hub for his mythos,
                                    called "Lovecraft Country" by later commentators. It represents the history,
                                    culture, and folklore of the region, as interpreted by Lovecraft.<img

                                        alt="Cartoon-like looking Mythos gods"> These attributes are exaggerated and
                                    altered to provide a suitable setting for his stories. The names of the locations in
                                    the region were directly influenced by the names of real locations in the region,
                                    which was done to increase their realism. Lovecraft's stories use their connections
                                    with New England to imbue themselves with the ability to instill fear. Lovecraft was
                                    primarily inspired by the cities and towns in Massachusetts. However, the specific
                                    location of Lovecraft Country is variable, as it moved according to Lovecraft's
                                    literary needs. Starting with areas that he thought were evocative, Lovecraft
                                    redefined and exaggerated them under fictional names. For example, Lovecraft based
                                    Arkham on the town of Oakham and expanded it to include a nearby landmark. Its
                                    location was moved, as Lovecraft decided that it would have been destroyed by the
                                    recently-built Quabbin Reservoir. This is alluded to in "The Colour Out of Space",
                                    as the "blasted heath" is submerged by the creation of a fictionalized version of
                                    the reservoir. Similarly, Lovecraft's other towns were based on other locations in
                                    Massachusetts. Innsmouth was based on Newburyport, and Dunwich was based on
                                    Greenwich. The vague locations of these towns also played into Lovecraft's desire to
                                    create a mood in his stories. In his view, a mood can only be evoked through
                                    reading.

                                    features prominently in many of Lovecraft's works. The institution finances the
                                    expeditions in the novellas, At the Mountains of Madness (1936) and The Shadow Out
                                    of Time (1936). Walter Gilman, of "The Dreams in the Witch House" (1933), attends
                                    classes at the university. Other notable institutions in Arkham are the Arkham
                                    Historical Society and the Arkham Sanitarium. It is said in "Herbert
                                    West—Reanimator" that the town was devastated by a typhoid outbreak in 1905.</p>

                                    which has a circulation that reaches as far as Dunwich. In the 1880s, its newspaper
                                    is called the Arkham Gazette. Arkham's most notable characteristics are its gambrel
                                    roofs and the dark legends that have surrounded the city for centuries. The precise
                                    location of Arkham is unspecified, although it may be surmised from Lovecraft's
                                    stories to be some distance to the north of Boston, probably in Essex County,
                                    Massachusetts.</p>

                                    The story "The Dunwich Horror" implies that Miskatonic University is a highly

                                    (written 1931, published 1936), and referenced in later works. Lovecraft first used
                                    the name "Innsmouth" in his 1920 short story "Celephaïs" (1920), where it refers to
                                    a fictional village in England. Lovecraft's more famous Innsmouth is in
                                    Massachusetts. This latter Innsmouth was first identified in two of his cycle of
                                    sonnets Fungi from Yuggoth. Lovecraft called Innsmouth "a&nbsp;considerably twisted

                                <p class="card-text text-justify">Lovecraft placed Innsmouth on the coast of Essex
                                    County, Massachusetts, south of Plum Island and north of Cape Ann. The town of
                                    Ipswich, Massachusetts is said to be a near neighbor, where many Innsmouth residents

                                    the northwest. This would place Innsmouth in the vicinity of Essex Bay. The
                                    description of the fictional Massachusetts village is said to be based on the real

                                    "Shoggoth's Old Peculiar" explains that the American Innsmouth was named after an
                                    older English village.</p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">Lovecraft writes that Innsmouth is in a horrendous
                                    state of decay, with many of the buildings rotting and on the point of collapse. The
                                    town was "founded in 1643, noted for shipbuilding before the American Revolution, a
                                    seat of great marine prosperity in the early nineteenth century, and later a minor
                                    factory center." The loss of sailors in shipwrecks, and the War of 1812, caused the
                                    town's profitable trade with the South Seas to falter; by 1828, the only fleet still
                                    running that route was that of Captain Obed Marsh, the head of one of the town's
                                    leading families.</p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">Prior to the events of the story, in 1840, Marsh
                                    starts a&nbsp;cult in Innsmouth known as the Esoteric Order of Dagon, based on
                                    a&nbsp;religion he had learned from certain Polynesian islanders in his travels. The
                                    town's fishing industry soon experienced a&nbsp;great upsurge. Then in 1846, a
                                    mysterious plague struck the town, killing most of the population, but in reality,
                                    the deaths were caused by the Deep Ones in league with Obed Marsh. When Marsh and
                                    his followers were arrested, the sacrificial rites ceased and the Deep Ones
                                    retaliated. The cult activity resumed, and interbreeding increased, spawning
                                    deformed fish-humans. Consequently, Innsmouth was shunned for many years, until 1927
                                    when it came under investigation by federal authorities for alleged bootlegging. The
                                    next year, an incursion by the authorities detonated explosives in Devil Reef off

                                <p class="card-text text-justify">The town of Kingsport first appeared in Lovecraft's
                                    1920 short story "The Terrible Old Man". Kingsport is based on Marblehead,
                                    Massachusetts, a&nbsp;town bordering Salem. In his letters, Lovecraft described
                                    Kingsport as being an idealized version of Marblehead. Its rocky cliffs were based
                                    on those in Marblehead and Rockport. Kingsport is, according to Will Murray,
                                    adjacent to Innsmouth. The town's exact location moved around according to
                                    Lovecraft's literary needs.</p>

                                <p class="card-text text-justify">Lovecraft created Kingsport before he saw its
                                    real-life model. When Lovecraft visited Marblehead in 1922, he became enamored of
                                    the town. In 1929 he wrote with much feeling of seeing the snow-covered town at
                                    sunset and of experiencing his "first stupefying glance of MARBLEHEAD'S huddled and
                                    archaick roofs". Indeed, "that instant—about 4:05 to 4:10 pm., Dec.&nbsp;17,
                                    1922—[was] the most powerful single emotional climax during my nearly forty years of
                                    existence."</p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">Lovecraft used Kingsport as a&nbsp;setting for his
                                    short stories "The Terrible Old Man" (written 1920, published 1921), "The Festival"
                                    (written 1923, published 1925), and "The Strange High House in the Mist" (1926,
                                    published 1931). A&nbsp;reprise of Lovecraft's epiphany appeared in fictional form
                                    at the end of Lovecraft's "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath" (1926-7, published
                                    posthumously in 1943). "Dream-Quest" featured Lovecraft's recurring character of
                                    Randolph Carter, popularly thought of as an idealized representation of Lovecraft
                                    himself. Carter, by Lovecraft's account, grew up in Kingsport.</p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">In the works of later writers, the town of Kingsport
                                    is described as having been founded in 1639 by colonists from southern England and
                                    the Channel Islands, where it soon became a seaport and center for shipbuilding.
                                    Influenced by the Salem witch trials, the town hanged four alleged witches in 1692.
                                    During the American Revolutionary War, the port was briefly blockaded by the British
                                    when the town's merchants turned to privateering against the British fleet. In the
                                    19th century, sea trade dwindled and the town turned to fishing as the main
                                    industry. Kingsport's economy continued to dwindle into the 20th century and today
                                    relies primarily on tourism.</p>
                                <h6 class="rpg-title card-subtitle world-slim-title">Manuxet River</h6>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">The Manuxet River is a&nbsp;fictional river that runs
                                    through Massachusetts and empties into the sea at the town of Innsmouth. Although
                                    there is a&nbsp;Manuxet River in Worcester, Massachusetts, Will Murray believes that
                                    Lovecraft based his fictional Manuxet on the Merrimack River and probably invented
                                    the name from root words of an Algonquian language.</p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">To support his claim, Murray gives two reasons. First,
                                    even though Newburyport was an inspiration for Innsmouth, it is clearly a separate
                                    location since Lovecraft himself placed the real-life Newburyport to the north of
                                    Innsmouth in "The Shadow Over Innsmouth". Murray thinks Lovecraft actually based
                                    Innsmouth's location on Gloucester, Massachusetts on Cape Ann. Secondly, Lovecraft
                                    is known to have created the name of the Miskatonic River from Algonquian root
                                    words. Murray believes Lovecraft used a&nbsp;similar method to come up with Manuxet:
                                    man means "island" and uxet translates to "at the large part of the river"; thus,
                                    when combined Manuxet means "Island at the large part of the river". Murray contends
                                    that this meaning is well suited to Innsmouth's placement at the mouth of the
                                    Manuxet. And Cape Ann itself (the presumed site of Innsmouth) is connected to the
                                    mainland by only a&nbsp;thin strip of land and might be thought of as an island.</p>
                                <p class="card-text text-justify">Innsmouth was attacked by the U.S. Treasury
                                    Department. During the assault in February, the frozen Manuxet allowed the attackers
                                    across to the town.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Though he died in poverty and throughout his life was published mostly in pulp magazines, Lovecraft's influence on media, that have anything to do with horror or mystery is huge.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">I believe that it is, among other things, the complex world, that he brought to live, that gives authors so much space to play around, while creating content based on The Mythos. Be it writers, expanding on it in their own literature, movie directors or game designers, anybody can find his own creepy corner in the Lovecraft Country.</p>
